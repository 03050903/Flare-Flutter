The Flare asset used has been built by Guido Rosso. To see how it's been built, take a look at the actual file [here](https://www.2dimensions.com/a/pollux/files/flare/heart-simple).

Inspired by [this ux_trends](https://www.instagram.com/p/BravnFGBHs0/) Instagram post.

## Overview

Add the `flare_flutter` library into the the [`pubspec.yaml`](pubspec.yaml) dependencies.

This example shows how to wrap a `FlareActor` with a `GestureDetector` to achieve a more engaging UI interaction. <br/>

Take a look at `buttons_row.dart` [here](lib/buttons_row.dart#L41) to see how this has been put together.
